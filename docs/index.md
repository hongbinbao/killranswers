Welcome to KillrAnswers's documentation!
========================================

KillrAnswers is an attempt to build a massively scalable microservice for managing Questions and Answers, similar to the features found on stackoverflow or Yahoo answers.  This service is meant to be run as part of your application infrastructure, and not exposed directly to a client, as it's raw calls and offers no security.
